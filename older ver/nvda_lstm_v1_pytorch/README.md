# NVDA LSTM - Version 1: PyTorch Baseline

## Overview
Initial PyTorch implementation of LSTM for NVDA stock prediction.

## Features
- Single stock (NVDA only)
- 1-day ahead prediction
- Basic technical indicators
- Simple LSTM architecture

## Files
- `nvda_lstm_pytorch.py` - Main implementation

## Key Results
- Baseline performance metrics
- Proof of concept for LSTM approach

## Next Steps
→ Extended to 5-day prediction in v2
